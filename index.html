                    Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            For a long time, the education sector has remained a top priority for the Indian government. Since 2002, the government has allowed the influx of 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the education sector. Between April 2000 to March 2020, the total FDI inflow in the country’s education sector was US$ 3.24 billion.
